In lesson 1 I learned four git commands:
1. git clone repository_url
	a command to clone a repository from git - all versions of the files get cloned to your local directory
2. git diff old_id new_id
	compare two git commits, an older one to a newer one, and see how many  and which lines changed
3. git log
	look at a history of commits from newest at the top to oldest. shows the commit ID and a comment 
4. git checkout commit_id
	look at an older commit 


new command:
git init
	creates a .git repositroy
git status
	shows which files have changed since the last commit



What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

when you initialize a repository a .git directory is created. This is necessary because it is within this hidden directory that git saves all the relevant metadata that allows you to keep track of versions of your files.
